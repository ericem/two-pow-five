# 2^5 Code Competition

## The Rules

> In celebration of Programmer's Day, Cerner is holding a programming competition
for the sixth year in a row. For 32 days (September 13-October 14th), we will
be accepting code submissions (in any language) that represent the concept of
engineering productivity.


* Any Cerner associate can participate.
* Submissions must be on a public repository on github.com.
* Only 1 submission per day will count.
* Submissions must be 32 lines of code or less.  (Lines will be counted based on the terminal symbols for the language, not based on a number of characters per line.) Comments will not count as lines.
* Include a comment in your code of "cerner_2^5_2019".
* The code must be syntactically correct.

## The Disclaimer

It should be obvious, but unless it is not clear, let me state it in plain terms: "NONE OF THIS IS PRODUCTION QUALITY CODE". These entries, while fully functional and packed with features, have little defensive code. Everything is happy path, with little or no error checking. What do you expect in 32 lines?? 

## The Entries

I work on a 'big data' operations team, therefore I have focused my entries for the 2^5 competition on applications and utilities that increase the productivity of a system engineer working in a similiar environment. For these first set of entries, I chose to use a language called Crystal. I originally selected Crystal because I am learning Ruby, a language used heavily in configuration management. However, as it turns out, Crystal stands on its own merits as a fantastic language for devops development and has become my secret weapon for building compact yet functional apps in a mere 32 lines of code. The tag line for Crystal is "Slick as Ruby, Fast as C." It has the same terse, easy to read syntax as Ruby, but is statically type checked and compiles to a single native binary for easy deployment. All great qualities for quickly building tools to improve engineering productivity.


### 1. Stack Overflow Trace (sotrace)

As I am new to Ruby, coming to the devops space from a background in Python, I find I spend a considerable amount of time on StackOverflow searching for answers to my Ruby problems. The 'sotrace' application, helps you reduce the debugging time of Ruby code by trapping errors and looking them up for you on StackOverflow. Presenting you with links to the top 10 answers to the error that you have received.
