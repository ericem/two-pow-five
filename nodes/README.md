# Knife Node Search Cache

## What is it?

If you have ever used the Chef Knife utility to search for a group of nodes,
you know that queries can be slow at times. This utility will transparently
cache the results of a Knife search, greatly speeding up your automation
when you want to do something with those results.

## Install Requirements

```
brew install crystal
```

## Compiling

To build a debug version, run make:

```
make
```

To build a release version:

```
make release
```


## Usage

The syntax for 'nodes' is extremely simple. It only supports a single type of Knife node index query based on the logical AND of two 'tags' fields.

Syntax:

```
nodes <tag1> <tag2>
```

Which translates to:

```
knife search node 'tags:<tag1> AND tags:<tag2>' -F json -a ipaddress
```

"Does it support more keys than the 'tags' key?" No! If I wanted more options I would use Knife! ðŸ˜› "Well, then what is it good for?" Lots of things if your infrastructure is setup with the UNIX philosphy in mind. Here are some examples.

### Examples

Find all webservers in the staging environment:
```
nodes staging webserver
```

Expected Output:

```
www1.example.com
www2.example.com
www2.example.com
```

Use Dig to resolve the hostname of the nodes and save the IPs to a file:

```
nodes staging webserver | xargs dig {} +short | tee webservers.txt

```

Expected Output

```
192.168.168.1
192.168.168.2
192.168.168.3
```

Ping all the webservers to see if they are up:

```
nodes staging webserver | fping
```

Note: If you don't have fping installed, you can get it from Homebrew. It's a wicked fast version of fping, designed for automation.

```
brew install fping
```

Use curl to check the webserver service is available:

```
nodes staging webserver | xargs curl -s -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 5 {} && echo "{} available" || echo "{} down"
```
