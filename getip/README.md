# Get Your IP Client (getip)

## What is it?

This is a utility designed to work with the getipservr service. The getipservr service returns the IP address of the client making the API request. This means if there are any firewall between the getip client and the getipservr, it will return the firewalls address to the client. In this way, the client can determine if it is behind a firewall. The getip client has some additional security features to make sure that it can verify the authenticity of the data it receives from the getipservr. 


## Install Using Homebrew

## Usage

The getip client has similar options to the getipservr, since they are designed to have a trust relationship between the two of them. To start the getip client, you must set the GETIP_KEY, GETIP_KEY, and GETIP_TOTPSECRET environment variables. The values for the variables must match the same values as set when starting the getipservr. The values for the secrets can be generated by the getipservr, see the README in that project for instructions.

Start getip:

```
GETIP_KEY=KEY GETIP_SECRET=SECRET GETIP_TOTPSECRET=SECRET getip URL
```



### Examples

```
GETIP_SECRET=IZUZp8mjSjhbpbdIAzViLogo1Io GETIP_KEY=mylinuxserver GETIP_TOTPSECRET=EknsvxhnoOk50-0hqgI3O1oYIWs ./getip https://getip.example.com:3000
```

Expected output:
```
10.8.8.8
```
